# KeepAndTrack
KeepAndTrack is a concept for app to help users to locate their stored items. For example where Do I have stored the floor lamp last november?Is it in the basement or loft? The concept is that the user only take one foto of this item, make a brief description of item and location, and give the main location (cellar for instance), when the item is stored. In a graphical frontend the possible storeplaces and the items are displayed in a way a standard house is structured, and it is also planned, that the user can set up the possible store places. For example, some may a have a garage for storing things, others not.  The items are displayed as small foto miniatures. Of course there will be a searchfunction.
